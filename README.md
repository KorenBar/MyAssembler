# MyAssembler
 Final Project of Course 20465 - "Systems Programming Lab" (Grade: 100)
 
 Use of:
- Dynamic memory.
- Bitwise operations.
- Bit-field, struct and union.
- Input and output files.

Some of the challenges:
- Use of the "-Wall" and "-pedantic" flags for GCC compilation.
- Not using global variables at all.
- Using C90.

Extra features: (that was not required)
- GCC like error pointing and coloring.
- Unlimited input length using my dynamic buffer.
- Summarizing requirements (helped other students too).
